New road and lots awaiting development are seen off Mulholland Drive in the Santa Monica Mountains on the western edge of Los Angeles. The mountains are the last semi-wilderness in Los Angeles County. Some 84 percent of the state's residents live within 30 miles of the coast, and this concentration has resulted in increased land use pressure. Of the 1,072 miles of mainland shoreline (excluding San Francisco Bay), 61 percent is privately owned.
